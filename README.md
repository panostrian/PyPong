# PyPong

The classic Pong game in Python using Pygame.

Currently have two versions v1 & v2.

v1 => PvP=Yes - Sounds=Yes - Menu=No  - Bot=No          --- Status : WORKS!

v2 => PvP=Yes - Sounds=Yes - Menu=Yes - Bot=Unfinished  --- Status : NOT WORKING (YET)

Problem:
1. Need to Deferentiate the Player paddle with the Bot paddle (when setting the bot paddle to follow the ball, the player's paddle does too.
2. Implement a Game Over screen - Score limit - Press R to restart
3. When starting the game , the Right wall (behind the Bot paddle) acts as a padle and bounces the ball.
4. The Bot paddle doesn't move at all
